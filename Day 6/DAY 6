DAY 6 



len () 

legth function is used to learn total numbers of charachters in the string .

str = "techtorial"

print(length(str)) # ->10 

print(type(len(str))) # <class 'int' >


# How do we access charachters from the string ?
                                                               Index numbers are RED      Order numbers are BLUE 
str = "Python
# I want to learn 4th letter from the string .
# To access the letter we need to use index numbers,
# and index numbers  start from 0.

I nedd to use index number 3.

What is the last index number in the str? 

Last index number is 5.
leng of the string is 6 

What do you think the relation between length of the 
string and the last index number of the string? 

Last index number of the every string is the length of the string -1 .


What is the syntax used to access letters from the string?

str = " python"

Accesing 3rd elements from the string 
Which index number should I use ?

2

print(str[2]) # t 





text = misteryValue 

# From this given string print the last letter.

# To be able to get last letter , I need to use last index number 

What is the last index number?
last_index = len(text)-1 # last index number 

print(text[last_index]) #last letter from the giving string .

What is the data type of a 
integer 
a=765
print(a[2]) ->integer object is not subscriptable

You can cast integer value to string and you can apply index numbers to get certain charachters.

# to cast any other data type to strimg type we use string function.
str()

a = str(a) 
print(a[2]) -> 5
