print(7 * 8)
# In the line below we are going to print number and the 
# text in the same line seperated bu coma .
# when we use coma in the print statement it adds 
# space after the first variable.

print("8 times 7 is",7 * 8)

print(8 -1)
print(" 8minus 1 is ",8 - 1 )

print(8 + 7)
print(" 8 plus 7 is ",8 + 7)

print(8 / 7)
print ("8 divided by 7is ", 8 / 7)

# Q:What will be the output of the print statement below?
print("8*7")
# A-> Syntax Error
# B-> 56
# C-> 8*7 ---this is the right answer because everything that we put in double qutation the python sees as a text 

# Everyting in the sigle or double qutation is called STRING 
# in python
