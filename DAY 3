DAY 3

Naming a variable in coding (programing)

There are 3 common ways you vane name a variable 

Pascal Case (TitleCase)

In Pascal Case naming every word starts with upper case 
NumberOfStudents = 32 

Camel Case

First woed starts with lowewr case and rest of the woeds start with uppercase(most common in java programmers) 


numberOfStudents=32

Snake Case

Every word starts with lower case and seperated by underscore (most common in python)


Operator Preseedce 

Arithmetic Operations

/,*,+,-

Division and multiplication is always done first,then substractin and additin is completed .

If both of the operator has same priority it will be done from lefth to right .


Complex Numbers 

Hoe do we create a variable?

a= 4+3j

What daes j mean?

root of 25 -> 5
root of 4-> 2
root of 9-> 3 


what is the root of -1 ? 

It cant be calculated however , it is assumed to be exist therefore we refer  
 j as root of -1





****************************************

More Aritmetic Operatins in Python 

Exponentiotin 

2 to the power of 3 

2 * 2 * 2 = 8

2** 3 = 8

3 ** 4 = 81

In a single line calculation exponentiotion is done befor divison and multiplication .

16 / 2 ** 3 -> 2


Integer Divison

If we divide two integer variable the result will be in floate type.

9 / 4 = 2.25 
9 // 4 = 2 

If you want to divide two numbers but don't want to get decimal point , you should use integer divison .

21 // 6 -> 3
21 /  6 -> 3.5



Remainder Operator (%)

 % operator has same presedence as multiplication and divison

 If remainder operator is done between 2 positive numbers the emainder will always be smaller than divisor .

 If remainder operator is done between 2 negative numbers the remainder will always be bigger than divisor.

// -1 % -3 -> -1 //

21 % 10 -> 1

10 % 11 -> 10

21 % 7 -> 0 

If result of remainder operation is 0 the number is divisible.
