Linux Bash -2

Note:To create comments in bash file we can use # sign.
The # sign in the first line is not a comment


Note: Every bash file can take as many arguments as possible .The numbers $1, $2, $3 etc. are used to access those command lime arguments .

How Can I learn how many arguments  are passed in the bash file?
********
         $#
            *******

Learning all the arguments that passed in the bash file
********
         $@
            *******
Note:Array is similar to list ,however there are some 
diffrences.
The array size is fixed, list size is dynamic.

How cn you access all the command line arguments as an 
array in a bash file?
 ********
         $@
            *******           

Read functin in bash works same as input function in python file.

ditermined by the number placed after the sleep command.
sleep 3, sleep 5, sleep 1 etc.
